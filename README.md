# Predicting employee turnover

Employee turnover is a big challenge for many companies. When workers leave frequently, it can be expensive and disruptive, causing delays, loss of expertise, and the need to constantly hire and train new employees. To help address this issue, we can use machine learning, a type of technology that allows computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions based on those patterns.

In this case, a machine learning model is designed to predict when employees might leave a company. It works by analyzing many factors, such as employee demographics, job roles, salaries, performance reviews, and even how long someone has been at the company. By looking at all this information, the model learns which combinations of factors make it more likely that an employee will leave.

This prediction allows managers to take action early, such as improving working conditions, offering additional training, or adjusting compensation before an employee decides to quit. The modelâ€™s success is measured using metrics like accuracy, which tells us how often the model correctly predicts who will leave, and precision, which shows how reliable those predictions are.

For instance, in testing, this model achieved 85% accuracy and 80% precision, meaning it provides fairly accurate insights into employee turnover risks, helping companies manage retention more effectively.
